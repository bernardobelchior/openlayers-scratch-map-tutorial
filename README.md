# OpenLayers Scratch Map Tutorial

Repository for a [tutorial](https://medium.com/@bernardo.belchior1/creating-a-scratch-map-using-javascript-openlayers-5-d92b92d2c609) I made on how to use OpenLayers to create your own simple scratch map. 
This repository was bootstrapped using [webpack-starter-basic](https://github.com/lifenautjoe/webpack-starter-basic).

Note: the `start` branch contains the project initial setup for you to follow the tutorial. 

## Running

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
